# Manual fixes needed for missing imports in RustyDB
# Apply these changes to fix compilation errors

## File: src/replication/mod.rs

Line 90 - Change:
  use parking_lot::RwLock;

To:
  use parking_lot::{RwLock, Mutex};

After line 92 (after `use tokio::sync::mpsc;`), add new line:
  use tokio::time::sleep;

These are the confirmed fixes needed. Other files may already be fixed or use fully qualified paths.

To verify after fixing, run:
  cargo check 2>&1 | grep "cannot find"

If empty output, all errors are fixed!
